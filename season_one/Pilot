( clock ticking )

( door opens )

Mr. Soprano?

Ahem. Yeah.

Have a seat.

( coughs )

My understanding
from Dr. Cusamano,

your family physician,
is that you collapsed.

Possibly a panic attack?

You were unable
to breathe?

They said it was
a panic attack.

Of course, all the blood work
and the neurological work

came back negative.

And they sent me here.

You don't agree
that you had a panic attack?

( sighs )

How are you feeling now?

Good.

Fine.

Back at work.

What line of work
are you in?

Waste management consultant.

Look, it's impossible for me
to talk to a psychiatrist.

Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

I don't know.

Stress, maybe.

About what?

Tony:
I don't know.

The morning of the day
I got sick, I'd been thinking.

It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

I came too late for that,
I know.

But lately,
I'm getting the feeling

that I came in at the end.

The best is over.

Melfi:
Many Americans
I think feel that way.

Tony:
I think about my father.

He never reached
the heights like me.

But in a lot of ways,
he had it better.

He had his people,
they had their standards,

they had pride.

Today, what do we got?

Did you have these
feelings of loss more acutely

in the hours
before you collapsed?

I don't know.

( rustling )

( ducks quack )

Tony:
A couple months before,

there's these two wild ducks
landed in my pool.

It was amazing.

They're from Canada
or someplace,

and it was mating season.

They had some ducklings.

Oh, what's the matter?

Come on, get some bread.

Come on.

Yum-yum. Yum-yum.

( quacking )

My daughter's friend was
there to drive my daughter,
Meadow, to school.

Meadow, your father
with those ducks.

Meadow:
I know, the whole yard
smells like duck poo.

- It's, like, embarrassing.
- Girls, you gotta have

more than just cranberry juice
for breakfast, all right?

You need brain food for school.

Happy birthday, handsome.
Mwah! Thirteen.

- Yeah, he doesn't act it.
- A.J.: Shut up.

The male and female duck made
a home in your pool and did it?

Ew! Get out of here!
You're so gross!

Girls, you want some
of last night's sfogliatelle?

Get out of here with that fat.

One bite.

How do you stay so skinny,
Mrs. Soprano?

Him, with those ducks.

Listen, if you don't
like that ramp,

I'll build you another one.

- Maybe it's the wood.
- ( quacking )

Hey! Hey, kids!
Come here!

Come here,
they're trying to fly!

- ( all groan )
- The babies!
They're trying to fly!

( ducks splashing )

Look, they're trying to fly.

Meadow:
National Geographic, Dad.

A.J.:
Yeah, super.

You showed us yesterday.

This is great!

Now my wife feels this friend
is a bad influence.

It's so cool you're gonna be
able to come to Aspen

with my family
at Christmas.

Last year at Aspen
I saw Skeet Ulrich,

as close as from
where you're sitting.

Oh, my God.

Miss Meadow,
we made a deal.

You keep your school grades up
and you keep your curfew

between now and Christmas,
then you get to go.

I know that.

- Morning, ladies.
- Hunter: Hey, Mr. Soprano.

- Meadow: We're late, Dad.
- Hey, happy birthday.

Thanks, Dad.

You're gonna
be home tonight

for Anthony Jr.'s
birthday party, right?

Birdman, hello?

Yeah. Yeah.
I'll get home early from work.

I'm not talking
about work.

This isn't gonna work.

I can't talk
about my personal life.

Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

Tony:
I drove to work
with my nephew, Christopher.

He's learning the business.

Now, he's an example of what
I was talking about before.

Did you call what's-his-name
down at Triboro Towers

about the hauling
contract?

I got home too late
last night.

I didn't want
to wake the man up.

Did you get up early
this morning and call?

He's always in his office
by 6:00.

I was nauseous
this morning.

My mother told me
I shouldn't even come in today.

Tony:
Bear in mind, this is a kid

who just bought himself
a $60,000 Lexus.

- There's that guy Mahaffey.
- Get out.

Yeah, right there
next to the boo-boo in pink.

Back up.

( tires screech )

My friend Mahaffey.

Pulling his taffy.

Hello.

Tony:
We saw this guy...

and there was this issue
of an outstanding loan.

Can I stop you for a second?

I don't know where
this story is going.

But there are a few
ethical ground rules

we should quickly
get out of the way.

What you tell me here

falls under doctor/patient
confidentiality.

Except, if I was...

If I was to hear, let's say,
a murder was to take place.

Not that I'm saying it would,
but if.

If a patient comes to me
and tells me a story

where someone's
going to get hurt,

I'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

Technically.

You said you were
in waste management.

The environment.

Dr. Cusamano, besides being
your family physician,

is also your next-door neighbor.

See what I'm saying?

I don't know what happened
with this fellow.

I'm-I'm...

I'm just saying.

Nothing.

We had coffee.

Woman:
Alex!

Mahaffey: Help!

♪ Don't know why
I love you like I do ♪

♪ Na-na-na-na ♪

♪ Know why I do ♪

Security! Help!

Oh, shit!

( tires screech )

♪ I just want
Your love to share ♪

♪ Now I wonder why ♪

♪ I love you like I do ♪

♪ Is it because
I think you love me too? ♪

♪ I wonder why ♪

♪ I love you like I do ♪

( tires screech )

Christopher:
Tony! Wait up!

♪ Don't know why I care ♪

♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh ♪

Mahaffey:
Security!

Hey, security!

( laughs )

( tires squeal )

- ( loud crash )
- ( Mahaffey screams )

( tires screech )

( Mahaffey whimpering )

- You all right?
- My leg is broken!

- The bone's coming through!
- Oh, let me see. Let me see.

- ( shrieks )
- I'll give you a fucking bone,
you prick!

Where's my fucking money?

So you had coffee.

Right.

You son of a bitch,
motherfucker!

What are you doing?
Get over here!

- Get over here!
- That's $3,000 here!

$3,000.

- Go ahead.
- ( kicks thudding )

( whimpering )

Where's our fucking money?

Mahaffey:
Ah! I'll get the money!

I know you'll get
the fucking money.

You know what you should get?
A cork in your fucking mouth,

because you tell people
I'm nothing

compared to the people
that used to run things.

- Sorry!
- Tony: You prick.

- ( sobs )
- I'm nothing?

I'm s...

( sobbing )

Shut up!

What are you
crying about?

HMO, huh?

You're covered,
you prick!

Degenerate
fucking gambler.

Melfi:
Go on.

Tony:
Next day,
I had a breakfast meeting.

I was called in to consult

by a garbage-hauling
company I represent.

All right, Big, what's the story
with Triboro Towers?

Well, the site manager wants
to renew his contract with Dick,

but this
Kolar Sanitation...

It's another
nationwide company.

Yeah, the Kolar brothers.

They're some kind
of Czechoslovakian
immigrants or some shit.

These Polacks, they'll haul
paper, plastic and aluminum

for 7,000 a month
less than Dick.

They pay us 40 times the monthly
for stealing your stop.

Pussy:
That's the thing. They won't.

He says if he can
tell the commie bosses
back in Czechoslovakia

to go fuck themselves,
he can fucking tell us.

Oh!

I give up.

Fucking garbage business.

Pussy: Yeah, I know.
It's all changing.

Let me see
what I can do.

Are you sure?

- You over your stomachache?
- Oh, yeah.

Good.

- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

Hey, Gabriella sends me
down here for the gabagool.

- The gabagool.
- Best in the area.

Hey, T, let me
ask you something.

You used to go to school
with a guy named Artie Bucco?

This situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

I can't go into details
on this one.

- That's fine.
- But I will say this.

My uncle adds
to my general stress level.

It's none of my business,

but down at the club,

word is your Uncle Junior
is gonna whack Pussy Malanga.

He's gonna do it at your friend
Artie Bucco's restaurant.

( music playing )

Hey, boys.
How are you?

Don't move.

Uncle Jun',
how you doing?

- Hey!
- ( laughs )

Hey, good to see you.

- Hiya, Chris.
- Hey, Uncle Junior.

Yeah, I was just
talking about you.

It's Anthony Jr.'s birthday
dinner tonight, right?

Yeah. Yeah.
Don't buy anything big.

We overindulge him.

( mutters in Italian )

Okay?

- Hey!
- Oh!

- Artie, how's your rash?
- It's itchy.

- ( both laugh )
- Tony: Come here.

Good to see you.

- Can you come over?
- Yeah, have a seat.

( sighs )

You know what it means
for Arthur,

one of these old mutts
gets wet in here?

Yeah. It'll ruin
his business.

You better sit down
with your uncle.

Tony:
Uncle Junior's
my father's brother.

Good guy.
Just getting old.

( laughing )

Cranky.

Used to take me to Yankee games
when I was a kid.

I love my uncle.

At the same time,
when I was young,

he told my girl cousins I would
never be a varsity athlete.

And, frankly,
that was a tremendous blow

to my self-esteem.

Livia:
Who's there?

It's me, Ma.

Who are you?

Ma, open the door.

- Anthony?
- Yeah, it's me.

Open the door.

( chain rattles )

Hi, how are you?

Geez, Ma,
get some air in here.

You lock the door
after you?

Yeah, I did.

You know, somebody called here
last night after dark.

Who?

You think I'd answer?
It was dark out.

Ma, I'll never
understand that.

The phone is an auditory thing.
Dark is an eye thing.

I can understand not
going out after dark.

You get jumped in the shadows,
whatever.

But not answering the phone
after dark?

Oh, listen to him.
He knows everything.

You want some lunch?
I got eggplant.

No. No. I just ate.

Know who I just ran into?
Uncle Jun'.

Oh, that one.

You think he ever comes
to see his sister-in-law?

Yeah.

Remember Artie Bucco?

Kid who I went
to elementary school with?

Artie. Oh!

Yeah, I still see
his mother.

( chuckles )

She tells me
he calls her every day.

Yeah, well...

Uncle Jun's gonna make
a problem for Artie.

Could affect
his livelihood.

What's that?

CD player.

For who?

- For me?
- Yeah.

I don't want it.

You don't want...?

You love music.

All the old stuff
is being reissued on CD.

All your old favorites.

"Pajama Game,"
Connie Francis.

Here.

( music plays on radio )

Come on. Come on.
Move around a little bit.

- It's good for you.
- What? What?

Oh...

Come on, come on.

Stop that.

Ma, you need something
to occupy your mind.

When Dad died, you were going
to do all kinds of things.

Oh, he was a saint.

Yeah, I know he was,
but he's gone.

You were gonna travel,

you were gonna get
a volunteer job.

- You've done nothing.
- Stop telling me how
to live my life.

Just shut up.

I just worry about you...

And don't start with that
nursing home business again.

It's not a nursing home!
How many times I gotta say this?

It's a retirement community.

You're with active seniors
your own age.

You go places.
You do things.

I've seen these women
in these nursing homes

in these wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots.

Here, eat your eggplant.

I told you,
I already ate lunch.

All right, listen.

You just speak to Uncle Junior
about Artie, okay?

He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

If your uncle has business
with Arthur,

he knows what he's doing.

And I don't?

Well, all I know is,

daughters are better at taking
care of their mothers than sons.

Yeah, and I bought CDs
for a broken record.

And I expect to see you tonight
at Anthony Jr.'s birthday party

with your baked ziti.

Only if I'm picked up
and I'm brought back home.

I don't drive when
they're predicting rain.

You're a healthy girl.
It's good for you to drive.

Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

Sure.

Run off.

And that night
was my son's birthday party.

My wife invites the priest.

He's always at the house.

- Hey, Tony.
- How you doing?

You like crème anglaise?

You bless it,
I'll eat it.

- She's not coming.
- Carmela: Who?

Grandma just called.

Started crying
and hung up.

( scoffs )

She needs a purpose
in life.

Your mother is tougher
than you think.

So what?
No fucking ziti now?

All: Hey!

( music playing )

( quacking )

( chuckles )

Tony:
At first, it felt like...

ginger ale in my skull.

( breathing heavily )

( coughs )

Meadow:
Mom, Daddy just fell! Mom!

- A.J.: Oh, my God!
- Carmela: Tony! Tony!

A.J.: Dad!

- ( Meadow screams )
- Carmela: Get back!

- Madonna mia!
- Meadow: Daddy!

Dad!

Carmela:
Anthony Jr., call 911.

( machine clicking )

Tony:
Dr. Cusamano put me
in the hospital.

Gave me every kind of test.

When you're in the MRI,

there's a microphone
by your head

if you get claustrophobia
and have to come out.

Only, I suggest
that you don't do that,

'cause we'd only have to start
over again from the beginning.

Okay.

Hey, Carm.

Thought you might
want some company.

Yeah.

6:30 in the morning.

How are the kids?

They're worried
about you.

I told Anthony Jr.
we'd rain-check his birthday.

Okay.

Think I got a brain tumor?

Well, we're gonna find out.

What a bedside manner.

Very encouraging.

What are you,
gonna not know?

We had some good times.

Had some good years.

Here he goes now
with the nostalgia.

Hey, all I'm saying is
no marriage is perfect.

Well, having that goomar
on the side helps.

I told you,
I'm not seeing her anymore.

How do you think I feel having
that priest around all the time?

Don't even go there,
all right?

Father is a spiritual mentor.

He's helping me to be
a better Catholic.

Yeah.

Well, we all got
different needs.

What's different
between you and me

is you're going to hell
when you die!

( sighs )

( machinery whirs )

( loud thud )

( airplane flying overhead )

Now, listen, Artie's

Hey, you kill him

You may run

Tony:
My wife and my daughter

Tony watches Godfather II

He says the camera work looks

Yeah, Gordon Willis.
Tony prefers II, not I?

Yeah. He likes the part

You locked my bedroom window

You have become a master

Melfi:
Didn't you admit
to Dr. Cusamano

that you were
feeling depressed?

Tony:
Melfi.

What part of the Boot
you from, hon?

Dr. Melfi.

My father's people
were from Caserta.

Avellino.

My mother would've loved it
if you and I got together.

Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

Suppose you were driving
and you passed out?

Let me tell you something.

Nowadays, everybody's gotta go
to shrinks and counselors

and go on Sally Jessy Raphael

and talk about
their problems.

Whatever happened
to Gary Cooper?

The strong, silent type.

That was an American.

He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

He just did what he had to do.

See, what they didn't know
is once they got Gary Cooper

in touch with his feelings,

that they wouldn't be able
to shut him up.

And then it's dysfunction this,
and dysfunction that,

and dysfunction vaffancul'.

You have strong feelings
about this.

Let me tell you something.

I had a semester and a half
of college,

so I understand Freud.

I understand therapy
as a concept.

But in my world,
it does not go down.

Could I be happier?

Yeah. Yeah, who couldn't?

Do you feel depressed?

Do you feel depressed?

Since the ducks left...

I guess.

The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

Let's talk about them.

( exhales )

( both grunting and panting )

You can't blame T
for being pissed.

You whacked this kid.
You should've waited for me.

That's the last time I show
any fucking initiative.

Imagine how I felt?

T's running down
the garbage business;

I just fucking wet a guy
to hold on to one of our stops.

He's not running it down.
It's getting harder in New York.

Back.

One, two, three!

Come on!

This is fucked up.

What, Pussy?

The Kolar uncle is gonna find
the kid dead in one of his bins

and get out of our
fucking business?

No way.

Louis Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

"Luca Brasi."

- Luca.
- Whatever.

There's differences,
Christopher, okay,

from the Luca Brasi situation
and this.

Look, the Kolars
know the kid is dead,
it hardens their position.

Plus, now,
the cops are looking
for a fucking murderer.

So, what do you wanna do?

He disappears.

He never comes home.

They know,
but they don't know.

They hope maybe
he'll turn up...if.

Yeah, yeah.

Come on. Let's get him.

- Pussy: Got him?
- Christopher: Yeah.

Pussy:
Take him to Staten Island.
I'll cut him up.

All right. Pussy, you know,
T collapsing at the birthday,

what would you do
if he was, like, disabled?

Pussy:
Why would you even ask that?

Our lecture series
in action.

It's someone from
the university

discussing the novels of,
I believe, Zora Neale Hurston.

Carmela: Hm!

Didn't you just read
her in school, Med?

It's very nice.

You know, Grandma,
this place is pretty neat.

You should really
think about it.

This room was renovated
last year.

What goes on
behind there?

Woman:
Those doors lead
to our nursing unit.

This is a nursing home!

- Ma...
- This is a residence,

but just in case--

No, you are not
getting me into--

- Ma, you're not listening.
- Ma, that's not what she said.

You're not listening
to what she's saying, Ma.

Livia:
I know these women
in their wheelchairs.

- Babbling like idiots.
- Ma, you're not listening.

- No, Anthony, please.
- Ma...

You think you're so
high and mighty, don't you?

With your fancy office.

Ma...Ma...

Anthony, people
come here to die.

( vase shatters )

Oh, my God!

Somebody get a doctor.

- Dad!
- Get a...oh!

So?

You've come back for help.

Don't look at that

She's part of that generation

that grew up
during the Depression.

But the Depression to her

There's that "D" word again.

( sighs )

Stay with your mother.

Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

When he was alive?

Nothing.

Hm!

And my dad was tough.

He ran his own crew.

A guy like that, and my mother
wore him down to a little nub.

He was a squeaking little gerbil
when he died.

Quite a formidable
maternal presence.

I gotta be honest
with you, I'm...

not getting any satisfaction
from my work either.

Why?

Well, because of RICO.

Is he your brother?

No, the RICO statutes?

- Of course. Right.
- You know? You read the papers?

You know the government's
using electronic surveillance

and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

Do you have any qualms about
how you actually make a living?

Yeah.

I find I have to be
the sad clown.

Laughing on the outside...

crying on the inside.

See, things are
trending downward.

Used to be a guy got pinched,

he took his prison jolt
no matter what.

Everybody upheld
the code of silence.

Nowadays, no values.

Guys today have no room
for the penal experience,

so everybody turns
government witness.

I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

Well, with today's pharmacology,

no one needs to suffer

with feelings of exhaustion
and depression.

Here we go.

( sighs )

So...

I hear that Junior wants
to whack Pussy Bompensiero.

Pussy Malanga.

- Oh, Little Pussy?
- Yeah, Little Pussy.

You think he's gonna fuck
with Big Pussy?

My Pussy?

Andrea.

Stay with drinks on the house,
all night.

Andrea:
Sorry, Mr. Dante.

- Sorry.
- Silvio: That's okay.

So...

your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

Sadness accrues.

Hesh:
Your uncle's had a hard-on

his whole life,
first against your father,

his younger brother,

because he was a made man
before him.

And now you.

So, sure, he can't stomach
your telling him what to do.

Hesh, I love the man.

The man is driven, in toto,

by his insecurities.

Silvio:
I feel bad I was the messenger.

Your friend, Artie,
with the restaurant,

get him out of town
for three weeks.

That way, the restaurant closes,

the hit has to go down
someplace else.

You old fucking Jew.

No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

So, what about this fucking
Jew's 250 on Mahaffey's 100?

All right, Mahaffey has
a new business partner:

You.

These HMOs,

they pay out millions
of dollars every day

to doctors, hospitals,
whatever the fuck.

That MRI I had?
$2,000 a pop.

Now, we give
this Mahaffey a choice.

He either has his company
start paying out phony claims

to fake clinics we set up,

or he pays Hesh
the 250 grand he owes him,

which we know he cannot do.

Or it's a rainy night
in Lyndhurst.

Very smart.

Could be major.

Could be as good as garbage.

Hey, garbage is our
bread and butter.

Was.

( knock on door )

Carmela:
Miss Meadow.

( music playing on radio )

So, Med...

I'm not going.

Every year on this date
since you were itty-bitty,

Mom and Meadow
get all dolled up,

drive into New York,
Plaza Hotel,

for tea under Eloise's portrait.

Look. Where's yours?

I have too much homework.

Meadow, it's our
little tradition.

We always have
so much fun.

To tell you the truth,

I felt it was dumb
since I was eight.

I just go
because you like it.

And here I thought this was
something we would do

long after you got married
with girls of your own.

Hopefully I won't be living
anywhere around here by then.

Computer:
You've got mail.

( computer clicking )

Meadow, you can't just
lie and cheat

and break the rules
you don't like.

What? You have something
you want to say to me?

Mom, do you have any idea

how much it means to actually
go skiing in Aspen?

I mean, do you think that's
gonna happen every year,

like lame tea and scones
at the Plaza Hotel?

Goodbye.

Close my door, please.

- Christopher: There he is.
- Artie.

Artie:
Okay, give me a drop.
Give me a drop.

Oh! A drop, not a spurt.

Suave, a drop.

- Artie.
- That's good.

- Hey!
- How are you?

All right,
stir the meatballs.

Listen, I was wondering
if you can help me out.

Yeah, what do you need?

Cruise, Caribbean,
"S.S. Sagafjord,"

- 11th through the 29th.
- ( whistles )

Pair of tickets.
I can't use them.

Can you take them
off my hands?

( laughs )
Where'd they come from?

Christopher: Comps.

Comps?

What does that mean, "comps"?

In my capacity
as business manager

for the Kitchen
and Restaurant Workers Union,

I administer the dental plan.

- You listening to me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

A couple of dentists got
together, and in appreciation,

they awarded me
these tickets.

Problem is,
I can't get away those days.

( bell dings )

- ( laughs )
- Here.

When's the last time
you got away and took
a little vacation?

Anthony, thank you.

All right.

Mr. Soprano...

( exhales )

You cannot accept a gift
like that from Tony Soprano.

- No way.
- Listen to me, Charmaine,

if I gotta stick my hand
up the ass of one more lobster

without taking a break,
I'm gonna go postal.

Arthur, I don't even want
to talk about it anymore.

Please!

Art...Art, Melissa.

Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

- Honey, you have to get away.
- Come on.

We have to get away,
for the marriage.

No! It's bad enough
that these mobsters

still come in and patronize
the place, okay?

But so, what?
We're not connected.

Right, because we just
turned down those tickets.

But the tickets were comps.

Tony is a labor leader.

Arthur, please grow up!

Does the mind not rebel
at any possible scenario

under which dentists are sending
the don of New Jersey

first class
on a Norwegian steamship?

Come on, Arthur.

Somebody donated their kneecaps
for those tickets.

Herman, there is no way I can
subvert my fucking company.

What, have them pay claims
for MRIs that never happened?

The paperwork will look
just like the real.

Well, how do I
not get caught?

Alex, I hate to hear you
knocking yourself like this.

Come on,
you're a smart guy.

I'm depressed.

I'm so fucking depressed
I can't eat, sleep.

- You on Prozac?
- Zoloft. It's similar.

It's supposed to help
with the gambling too.

- Yeah? No shit.
- Yeah, well,

this whole new generation
of antidepressants

are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

That's a shame.

A medication comes along
after your gambling

gets your fucking hip
busted to shit.

- I'm trying not to be cynical.
- Hesh: Alex, son,

your debt and the feeling
surrounding it

is the source
of all your problems.

You know it and I know it.

I'm sorry I haven't paid you,
Herman.

I know you are.

And I never meant
to denigrate Tony Soprano.

Hey, you wanna go
for a walk in the rocks?

- The crutches. I can't.
- Come on. It's beautiful there.

Come on.
We'll help you.

I go out there to think.

( melody jingling )

Thanks, but no.

Let's try it.

What you were saying before,
you know, with the MRIs.

( train whistle
blares distantly )

( airplane flying overhead )

( pills rattling )

Paulie:
T!

Dick's looking for you!

Hey, Tony.

I just heard from
Triboro Towers.

The Kolar brothers
withdrew their bid.

That's good.
That's good.

Oh, listen, by the way,
Artie Bucco's here to see you.

I gotta go, guys.

- Take care.
- I'll see you.

Tony:
Artie!

Artie, you all right?

I can't.

What are you
talking about?

We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.

I'm sorry.

( bulldozer engines roaring )

( indistinct chatter )

Nils:
This is unacceptable.

I had an 8:00 reservation
I made two weeks ago.

Sir, as I explained,

people are not leaving
their tables,

and there are five parties
ahead of you.

- So, what would you like--?
- Can I help you?

I tore her a new one.

Why don't we just go
to another restaurant and eat?

We're here.

Owner:
Mr. Soprano, how you doing?

Tony:
Giuseppe, how you doing?

- Hey.
- Signora, come stai?

This way. Excuse me.

Irina:
Sweetie pie, I'm hungry.

- Tony, where are you going?
- Hey.

Tony: Hey.

How are you?

Good.

You come here?

When possible.

Tony:
Hey, listen,

those decorating tips
you gave me,

they really work.

Good.

How you doing?

Nils. Nils.

Do you know who that was?

Well, I mean,
obviously, you do.

What, is he a patient?

You know I can't say.

( inaudible )

Decorating tips.
Yeah, right.

Nils, shut the fuck up.

Mr. Borglund, they're
setting up your table right now.

Whoa.

Irina:
Who was that woman tonight
at the restaurant?

Tony:
My decorator.

Irina:
What, you're redoing
the garbage dump?

Tony:
That's funny.

Hey, you better not
be messing with that hat!

Goddamn! Come on!
That's JFK's hat!

I bought it
at that auction!

Give me that!

Irina, Jesus.

I know there is something more
intimate between you and her.

Nothing intimate.
We just talk.

Yeah.

Oh, like that.

Mr. Soprano,
buonasera.

Months we don't see you.
Where you been?

Signora Carmela.

Da questa parte.

You know, sometimes...

life is good.

Life is often good.

True Regaliali, for example.

You been in good spirits
the last couple days.

Carmela...

something I gotta confess.

What are you doing?

Getting my wine in position
to throw in your damn face.

You're always
with the drama, you.

Go ahead and confess already,
please, get it over with.

( sighs )

I'm on Prozac.

Oh. Oh, my God.

I've been seeing a therapist.

( gasps )
Oh, my God.

I think that's great.

I think that's so wonderful.
I think that's so gutsy.

- All right, take it easy.
- I just think that's wonderful.

Well, you'd think
I was Hannibal "Lecture"
before or something.

I just think it's great.

Psychology doesn't
address the soul.

That's something else.
But this is a start.

This is something.
Oh, I'm gonna shut up now.

I'll shut up now.

You're the only person
who knows.

The only reason I'm telling you
this is 'cause you're my wife,

and you're the only person
on this planet

that I'm completely
and totally honest with.

Oh, please.

Hey, goddamn it,
I'm serious.

The wrong person
finds out about this,

and I get a steel-jacketed
antidepressant

right in back of the head.

( sighs )

I didn't realize
you were so unhappy.

I don't know.

My mother...

You told him about
your father, right?

- Who?
- Your therapist.

Yeah.

Yeah, I told him.

Oh, good.

But your mother
is the one.

I don't know.

I just feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

My own daughter hates me.

( scoffs )

She doesn't hate you, Carm.

We were best friends.

Mothers and their daughters.

She'll come back to you.

( phone rings )

Hello?

Jesus, I got through.

What's the matter,
no social life?

Blow me.

- Dad!
- I brought you my primavera.

It's your favorite.

- Who is it?
- Christopher.

- Hey.
- Friend of ours
just got back in town.

Newscaster on TV:
Little Pussy Malanga,

sometimes confused with fellow
mobster Big Pussy Bompensiero,

had just returned
from Florida when he was...

So it's gonna go down soon?

Don't worry about it.
I got a way to put it to bed.

( spectators cheering )

Tony:
Come on, Meadow!

- Go, Falcons!
- Let's go!

So when do you
need this by?

Right away.

Way to go, Meadow!

Beautiful. Beautiful.

Meadow:
I got it!

I think I can get a party
like that together.

Side out?
That ball hit the line.

What are you doing, ref?

Mom didn't come?

Didn't think
you wanted her to.

The car's over there.

- Hey, Mr. Dante.
- Hi.

- Meadow: See you, Heather.
- Hey.

You guys played
a good game.

That Heather Dante,
where'd she get that spike?

Dad, don't you think
it's totally unfair

what Mom is doing?

And now, like, making this
little movie scene out of it.

The sad mom who can't even come
to her daughter's sports events.

( sighs )

Dad.

Don't you think
it's totally out there?

I mean, my Aspen trip.
What is she thinking?

Dad?

It's been years
since I've been here.

Dad, please talk to her.
Please.

This is so stupid.

Why are we sitting here?

You know, your mother thinks
you have the capacity

to be a top student,

and I agree.

What do you guys want,
perfection?

What are you looking at?

Your great-grandfather
and his brother Frank,

they built this place.

Big whoop.

Stone and marble workers.

They came over here from Italy,
and they built this place.

Yeah, right.

Two guys.

No.

There were two guys
and a crew of laborers.

They didn't design it...

but they knew
how to build it.

Go out now
and find me two guys

who can put decent grout
around your bathtub.

( car door opens and closes )

( car alarm blares )

So I feel good.

So I don't know if I'm gonna
be needing to come back.

It's not the Prozac.

Why not?

You said you're
thinking clearer,

and your wife says
you seem to be better?

It's not the medication.

Prozac takes several weeks

to build up effective levels
in the blood.

Well, what is it, then?

Coming here. Talking.

Hope comes in many forms.

Well, who's got time for that?

What is it you want
to say to me?

I had a dream last night.

My belly button was a...

Phillips head screw.

And I'm working
unscrewing it.

And when I get it unscrewed...

my penis falls off.

( clears throat )

You know, I pick it up,
and I'm holding it,

and I'm running around
looking for the guy

who used to work on my Lincoln
when I drove Lincolns,

so he can put it back on.

And, you know,
I'm holding it up,

and this bird swoops down
and grabs it in its beak...

and flies off with it.

( sighs )

What kind of bird?

I don't know.

Seagull or something.

A waterbird?

I saw The Birds
last week on cable.

You think maybe
that planted the idea?

What else is a waterbird?

Pelican.

Flamingo.

What about ducks?

Those goddamned ducks.

What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

I don't know,
it was just a trip

having those wild creatures
come into my pool

and have their little babies.

I was sad to see them go.

Oh, Jesus, fuck.
Now he's gonna cry.

( sobbing softly )

( sniffling )

Shit. Fuck me.

When the ducks gave birth
to those babies,

it became a family.

You're right.

That's the link.

The connection.

I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my family...

like I lost the ducks.

That's what I'm full
of dread about.

That's always with me.

What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

I don't know.

( children shouting distantly )

( sighs )

You work so hard.

You work so damn hard.

And to see your
life's dream...

burn down.

Look at it this way.
You collect the insurance.

That's all.

Arthur, you gotta
say to yourself,

- it could've been worse.
- Yeah.

Artie:
How could it have been worse?

Fucking faulty stove.

Suppose people stop
coming to the restaurant?
You ever think of that?

I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

He's right about that.

There's no insurance
for that.

But why would people stop
coming to the restaurant?

It's just starting
to catch on.

Know what I'm
figuring out lately?

Talking helps.

That's right.

He's right, he's right.

Hope comes in many forms.

Absolutely.

- ( sobs )
- Tony: Come on.

Oh, jeez.
Here, hold this.

Come on. Artie...

Artie, come on.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

( sighs )

I'll always help you.

Come on. Come on.

( cries )

( music playing on radio )

Go cook.

Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better. Go ahead.

Hey, someday I'll tell him
we torched the restaurant

as the best solution.

All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong with you?

You know, a simple,
"Way to go, Chris,"

on the Triboro Towers contract
would've been nice.

That's it.

You're right.

You're right.

I have no defense.

That's how I was parented.

Never supported.
Never complimented.

You know, my cousin
Gregory's girlfriend

is what they call
a development girl

out in Hollywood,
right?

She said I could sell my life
story, make fucking millions.

I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you.

I'll fucking kill you.

What are you gonna do,
go Henry Hill on me now?

You know how many mobsters
are selling screenplays

and screwing
everything up?

She said I could maybe
even play myself.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

( scoffs )

Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

What do you think,
I haven't had offers?

You got work to do.

New avenues.

Everything's gonna be
all right from here on in.

Come on.

( laughs )

Lookit, it's a beautiful day.

What could be bad?

It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

At least somebody
cares about me.

- These kids today.
- I suppose he thinks

once he's got me locked
in a nursing home,

I'll die faster.

And then he won't have
to drive me anywhere.

Well, if his father
were still alive,

you can bet your boots

he'd show more decency
and respect for his mother.

Well, my brother John
was a man among men.

He was a saint.

Anyway, lots of things
are different now

from Johnny's and my day.

What do you mean?

I'm not free to run
my business like I want.

Oh, isn't that awful.

Just this week,
your son stuck his hand in.

Made it a hundred times
more difficult for me.

Plus, he thumbs his nose
at New York.

- Oh!
- What are you gonna do?

He's part of a whole generation.

( car horn blares )

You remember the crazy hair?

And the dope.

Now it's fags
in the military.

Stop it, Junior.

You're making me very upset.

I don't like to, Livia,

but I'm all agita
all the time.

And I'll tell you
something else.

Things are down
all across the board.

A lot of friends of ours
are complaining.

We used to be recession-proof.

No more.

You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

Our friends say to me,

"Junior, why don't you take
a larger hand in things?"

Something may have to be done,
Livia, about Tony.

I don't know.

There they are.
Hey, Ma. Uncle Jun'.

You're using mesquite.

That makes the sausage
taste peculiar.

Hi, Grandma.

Happy birthday,
my big boy.

Carmela,
my mother's here.

Everybody, let's eat!

( uplifted chatter )

Corrado:
I want him to open
my present first.

Paulie:
Hey, Arthur. Arthur.

What am I,
babysitting for you?

( indistinct chattering )

Hunter:
Hey, Meadow,
I'm not gonna eat, are you?
