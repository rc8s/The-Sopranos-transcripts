John Gotti.

Life in prison.

No chance of parole.

We've seen arrests
and prosecutions

in Florida and elsewhere
of top Mob figures.

What are you doing?
Put that back.

Paulie: Oofah!

Boxing Commentator:
Mosley not yet working
to establish...

What's the situation
on the ground today,

right now, in the Mob?

Braun:
Confusion.

Instability.

Vacuum at the top.

- What caused the decline?
- Your sister's ass.

Braun:
An aggressive government policy

over two decades

to behead the crime families.

Host:
But wasn't it,

at least in part,

a disregard
within the Mob itself,

of the rules that served
the old dons so well?

- If the shoe fits.
- Braun: Oh, there's no doubt.

Sil, cheer me up, babe.

Just when I thought
I was out,

they pull me back in.

( all laugh )

Is that Pacino
or is that Pacino?

Fucking spitting image.

- Host: Vincent Rizzo.
- Rizzo: Yes.

Host:
Former soldier
in the Genovese family.

Government witness-turned
bestselling author.

Do you agree with
U.S. Attorney Braun?

The party's over.

He is a wiseguy.
Please elaborate.

Rizzo:
Well, it's not like it was.

Cloning.

Mexicans are huge in that.

Fascinating, gotta admit it.

Because they work
as parking valets.

Rizzo:
I mean, now, do I mean
that organized crime

is just gonna
pack its bags voluntarily

and go the way
of the dodo bird?

Braun:
Vincent, they're not
going the way...

What the fuck
are you talking about?

Mexicans.

Well, what about them?

Cell phones.

I'm not talking
about cloning cell phones.

Jesus, I'm talking
about fucking sheep.

Science.

I tell my kids,
only God can make a life.

Guy here asks,

"What if they had cloned
Princess Di?"

But you know, the heyday?

You know, the golden age,
or whatever, of the Mob?

That's gone.

And that's never coming back.

And they have only
themselves to blame.

( mutters in Italian )

They pay this chiacchierone
by the word?

I think it's drug trafficking.

- Oh!
- And I think that
ruined everything.

You're looking at a mandatory
35 to life in prison.

Guys started
to rat on each other

just so they could
avoid prosecution.

What's going on
with that Princess Di?

Think the royal family
had her whacked?

( chuckles )

Last time I take
a fucking limo in Paris.

Like you were
ever in Paris, Paulie.

I went over for a blowjob.

Your mother was working
the bonbon concession

at the Eiffel Tower.

Sil, did you hear
what I told him?

Told him I went over
for a blowjob.

"Your mother was working
the bonbon concession

at the Eiffel Tower."

I got a list of people long as
my leg I wouldn't want cloned.

The fucking mayor of New York,

that's the guy least likely
to get cloned.

So the code of silence,
or the omertÃ¡,

or whatever you want
to call it,

just went by the boards.

You're always gonna have
organized crime.

Always.

As long as the human being

has certain appetites
for gambling,

pornography or whatever,

someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs.

Always.

Just when I thought
I was out,

they pull me back in.

( record needle scratches )

( music playing on truck radio )

( speaking Spanish )

( brakes squeal )

You got DVD players in back?

- Don't hurt me, man.
- Only people get hurt,

the ones who try
to be fucking jerk-offs, okay?

Now step down, nice and easy.
Come on, move it.

Come on, he's got
the DVD players.

Hey, quick and painless.
Nobody wants to hurt your ass.

Okay, but you gotta
tie me up.

You gonna be

My boss is gonna think
I'm in on it.

What, do we look like
we're trying for a merit badge?

We travel around with rope?

I've got some in the cab.
Please, I need this job.

Okay, Jesus Christ,
get him the rope.

Look, I don't know
who in the company
gave up the route,

but there's no way
I could walk away unscathed

without being fired.

- You want to be scathed?
- Yeah.

So it looks like I didn't
give up without a struggle.

- Oh!
- Driver: Oh, that's cool.
Thank you, man.

That's enough.

No, wait.

Oh!

( grunts )

( muttering in Spanish )

- Scathed?
- Scathed.

He's scathed.
All right.

( birds tweeting )

Mr. Miller,
my science teacher,

he got his car stolen.

You're kidding.
From where? His house?

Mm-mm. Right from
his parking spot at school.

- Oh.
- A Saturn.

He only had it like a year.

The security people
at that school are a joke.

Did you hear what Anthony Jr.
just said?

Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

Refresh my memory.
Who's he again?

Carmela:
He's your son's
science teacher.

♪ Well, the Miller
Told his tale ♪

You're up early, Dad.

He just bought that car
a year ago.

So? Insurance will pay.

Yeah, but they don't give
full value.

And these poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

So he can work
his summer vacation.

( laughs )

Maybe you could help find it.

Funny, I thought I told you
I changed my name

from LoJack
to Anthony Soprano.

Laugh. I thought
I'd pee in my pants.

Seriously, though.
Pussy's got the body shop.

He couldn't ask around?

Meadow: I'm late.

What are you getting in science?

D-plus.

See what I can do.

That's not what I meant.

He's gotta work
for his grades.

Here, eat this.

( music blaring )

Technology comes
to the Bing!

Hey, Christopher,
where you been?

Come on.

- Let's go.
- Come on, come on.

- Hey, is the load here?
- Yeah.

( cell phone rings )

Georgie, if a guy named Serge
calls, tell him I'll be back.

Ton', these new phones systems.
Hold, conference.

Sometimes I get confused.

How complicated is it?

You answer the phone,
you take the fucking message.

The voice mail only comes on
if you let the phone ring.

Jesus Christ, Georgie.

( sighs )

I hear there's not as many
titles available as on laser.

You know, there's
more coming, though.

My internist told me
the picture's not that different

from the laser either, Ton'.

But the sound? Way improved.

Good, because nothing beats

popping up some
Orville Redenbacher's

and listening to Men in Black,
you know?

- All right, fuck it.
- Hey, hey. No, no.

It's the goddamn wires,
that's all.

I'll be glad
to hook it up, Ton'.

You know,
I used to be an installer.

Why can't you be nice
to Brendan?

We discussed that.

( music playing )

Georgie:
Ton', I was just
gonna come looking.

It's the guy for you.

Serge?

I'll take it over there.

Serge?

You press "hold"
when you transfer a call.

I'm sorry, Tony.

Now he's not gonna call back.

Brend's a good earner, T.

This jack was his plan.

Yeah, he's a good kid, but I
don't like that methamphetamine.

Ah, fuck.
I gotta call my mother.

( phone line rings )

( ringing )

Hello?

Hello, Ma?

Oh! Look who calls!

How you doing?

I was wondering when
you were gonna call.

Well, you can stop
wondering now.

This is it.
I'm calling you.

I called you yesterday,
remember?

You were supposed
to call me back?

I phoned your house.

Some operator
answered the phone.

I couldn't understand
a word she was saying.

Ma, how many times
I gotta tell you?

That's not an operator.
That's an answering machine.

Oh, fancy, fancy.

Here, let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

( vehicle approaching )

( car brakes squeak )

You know, you and my mother,
you're like two peas in a pod.

She can't master the phone
either, but she's 70 years old.

What's your fucking excuse?

( sizzling )

What is she doing now?

( fire crackling )

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

Ma.

Ma?

( tap water runs )

Hey, Ma!

Oh, my God!

Ma!

Where the hell is she?

- Who is this?
- It's Anthony.

The mushrooms,
they're on fire.

All right, Ma, get the fire
extinguisher under the sink,
the one I gave you.

- Get it.
- Oh, my God!

The wall's getting all black!

All right, Ma,
hang up and call 911.

Ton', the guy's
on the second line.

Livia:
Aren't you coming over?

You press "hold,"
goddamn it!

Listen, Ma, I can't come over.
I'm 40 minutes away.

You hang up and you call 911
and leave the house.

Look at how I live!

Ma, hang up and call 911.

- Carmela on phone: Hello?
- Carmela, my mother's
got a fire in the kitchen.

- Oh, my God.
- Look, she's calling 911.

Can you get over there, please?

Yeah, I'm on my way.

Thank you, baby.
I know you're busy.

Serge. Serge.

All right, listen, I can't
talk to you right now.

I gotta go
to an outside line.

Give me your number.

All right. All right.
I'll call you back.

Is your mom okay?

This shit cannot
go on like this.

Pussy:
Hey, T.

Hey, T.

This teacher,
they stole his car.

You got a plate number?

I'll call my wife.

( indistinct radio chatter )

Have a nice day, ma'am.

- Thanks, fellas.
- No problem.

Ma...

I wish you would let me get
somebody in here to help you.

You shouldn't be alone.

Help me what?

With the housework.

I have my ways.

A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

Can I tell you something,
though, Ma?

You need company.

Now, don't start with that
nursing home business again.

This is not a nursing home.

It is a retirement community.

( fire truck driving away )

Want me to make you
a little pastin,

get a little something
in your stomach?

Ma, now I've told Tony

and I've told you
many times.

You know you can always
come and live with us.

I know when I'm not wanted.

I just invited you
to come and share my home.

You want me to beg,
that's different.

Leave this place...

that my husband
and I shared?

Well, change can be a positive.

He was a saint.

That son of mine,

is he still
having those fits?

They're not fits, Ma.

They're anxiety attacks.

No, he's on medication.

( power tools whirring )

What BMW's charging us
for paint?

O trippa di zia.

Been that way
for six months.

When was I last here?

Hey...

we maybe caught
a break here, boss.

Shop on Watchung Avenue
said some guy's brought in

a Saturn with these plates,
trying to unload it for parts.

Are you telling everybody this
fucking car's for Tony Soprano,

and leave it all
in one piece?

Yeah. Sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

My guy said that
one of those goofballs

had a uniform on
from, uh... Buttfuck's.

Whatever. The coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

Watchung Avenue and what?

I'm fucking Rockford
over here.

( music playing )

Decaf cappuccino prima
nonfat magnifico,

double espresso regolare.

I'll take you
over here, sir.

I think I'll have
an espresso.

Paulie,
you want anything?

They got any just coffee?

Our cafe du jour
is New Zealand peaberry.

Marone.

Whatever.

That's 4.20.
Pick it up over there.

One medium du jour.
One single espresso regolare.

Pussy:
Here, keep it.

Man:
Du jour, espresso, coming up!

Pussy:
Honey, let me ask you.

My wife was in the body shop
around the corner

on Watchung Avenue
the other day.

The guy in front of her leaves,

and she sees he dropped
his money clip,

but he was already gone.

And we'd like
to get it back to him.

She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

Real black hair, she said,
tall, little earring.

I'm sorry, sir,
but these stores are everywhere.

Yeah, tell me about it.

Fucking Italian people.

How did we miss out
on this?

What?

Fucking espresso,
cappuccino.

We invented this shit,

and all these other cocksuckers
are getting rich off it.

Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

It's not just the money.
It's a pride thing.

All our food.

Pizza. Calzone.
Buffalo mozzarella.

Olive oil.

These fucks had nothing.

They ate puzzi before we gave
them the gift of our cuisine.

But this?
This is the worst.

This espresso shit.

Take it easy.

So she finally agreed to have
somebody come in days.

Carmela called an agency,

and they sent over
this Trinidadian woman.

But no matter
what I do,

I feel guilty.

Why?

Well, the real reason is,

I know I can't let her
live with us.

That doesn't seem
very practical,

given her personality.

Well, it's my wife.

She won't allow it.

Where are your sisters
in all this?

Oh, they cut it off with her
a long time ago.

No way she's bunking with them.

So you're carrying
all this guilt

when your mother is clearly
someone who has great difficulty

in maintaining a relationship
with anyone.

But she's my mother.

You're supposed to take care
of your mother.

She's a little old lady.

Not to you.

She's very powerful.

Bullshit.

You accord this
"little old lady"

an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

Let me tell you something.

You definitely don't
wanna get her started.

There are some people

who are not ideal candidates
for parenthood.

Come on.

She's an old sweetie pie.

What were some
of the good experiences

you remember as a child?

The loving, warm ones.

One time we were down
at the shore,

about '68, '69,
the whole family.

My father, he tripped
and he fell down the stairs,

and we were all laughing.

The whole family
was laughing.

My mother was laughing.

Any other loving
experiences?

Hey, she's a good woman.

She put food on that table
every night.

I'm the ungrateful fuck

'cause I come here
and I complain about her,

and I let my wife
exclude her from my home.

( doorbell rings )

Hey, Ma?

- You Perrilyn?
- Yes.

- Tony Soprano.
- Ah.

- Tony: How you doing?
- Perrilyn: I'm fine, thank you.

Olivia, your son is here!

And isn't he a handsome thing?

And look what he brought.

Listen...

let's get one thing straight.

In the hours you're here
taking care of my mother,

no ganja, okay?

Hey, Ma!

Fiore.

I'm not dead,
unfortunately for some.

The tall ones
are delphiniums.

You know, Frankie Valli,
when he visits Jersey,

this is the florist
he uses.

Perrilyn:
Aren't they beautiful?

You want me to put them on
the dining room table, Olivia?

You make sure the bottom
of that vase isn't wet.

Mr. Tony, would you like
some tea or something?

Coke. Thanks.

So how's it going today?

( tap water runs )

She's stealing.

Who?

That ditsoon, "who."

That beautiful plate

that Aunt Settimia took
from that restaurant in Rome,

it's gone.

I don't know, Ma.

She seems like
a nice person.

She doesn't fool me
for a second.

( humming )

Sure she stole it?

Sure you didn't give it
to one of the relatives?

You keep forcing
your possessions on people,

thinking you're gonna die.

I wish it was tomorrow.

( sighs )

And she's so forward too.

Who does she think she is?

She's happy, Ma.

She's singing.

Anthony, I don't want her
around here.

I can manage somehow.

No. No.

I'm not caving into you
this time.

She stays.

Your uncle called here
looking for you.

Uncle Jun'?

He sounded agitated.

Corrado:
Jackie, you're the boss.

Tell them to leave
Comley Trucking alone.

Didn't know it was
a Comley truck.

For 21 fucking years,

Comley's been putting food
on my table.

Protection money.

Hey, Chris didn't know
going in.

Bullshit.

You want my DVD player?
You can watch Grumpy Old Men.

You're gonna be a fucking
funny boy too, now, huh?

Hey, you're Sopranos.

Tony: Yeah,
but Jackie, you go around

hoping you and your uncle
can settle a thing,

just the two of you, not be
invited to a fucking sit-down.

You got fucking Chiricahuas
working for you.

- You don't control them.
- Tony: Here we go.

- Here we go.
- Jackie, you got a ruling?

The kids who hit that truck,
they make restitution to Junior.

Done. It's done.

Christopher Moltisanti's
a fucking loose cannon.
And that Filone kid--

- For this, you get a man
out of a sick bed?
- Hey, fuck that shit.

Giacomin', how you feeling?

I may be acting boss

while the old man's a guest
of the government,

but I wish somebody'd
tell my bowels,

'cause they don't obey.

Ah, the fucking chemo.

Maybe I should name a successor.

This day and age?

Who wants the fucking job?

Your mom tells me you got a girl
coming in to help?

That's good.

All right, I gotta go.

I'll see you soon.

We okay?

All right.

A smoke he hires
for his own mother.

Hey, Mikey, how's the boy?

- What boy is that, Ton'?
- The one you sleep with.

Oh.

I was just kidding you.
How you doing?

- I'm all right.
- How's my uncle treating you?

We're covering our nut.

Hey, your nephew,
what's he, retarded?

He likes to play
with trucks or something?

"Retarded"? What if Jerry Lewis
heard you talking like that?

Oh, that's
muscular dystrophy, Ton'.

It's too bad they
don't have a telethon
for fuckface-itis, huh?

They found a cure yet?

Come on.
I'm just kidding you.

Come on,
you're a good sport.

Come on. All right.

- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right. You?

- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

( sighs )

Man:
Double cappuccino suprema.

Woman:
Double cappuccino suprema.

Pussy:
Thanks.

Excuse me.

Man:
Large nonfat latte.

A guy fitting the description
does work in this here branch.

His name is Eduardo Arnaz.

Him and his gay lover
both work here.

And I got the address.

Paulie, you listening to me?

Yeah.

Oh, again with the rape
of the culture.

Can we go find these
Spice Girls already
and get this over with?

Man:
Two small coffee du jours.

Woman:
Half cap on one.

( door opens and closes )

- What?
- That's it!

What happened?

Beats me.

Did you say
something to her?

Look, I know how
to talk to people.

These blacks.

Who knows what they're gonna
take the wrong way?

So she's gone.

Radio Announcer:
Traffic and weather together
on this Tuesday morning.

Here's Heather in the chopper.

Woman on Radio:
Over here on the West Side,

the delay again this morning
at the inbound Lincoln Tunnel.

About a 25-minute delay

if you're approaching it
near Route 3.

The queue there beginning
just before the Bergen Viaduct.

Tony:
You got your goddamn
marching orders yesterday.

Why didn't you pay the man
his restitution?

Brendan:
Restitution, okay, but you know
how much he wants, your uncle?

Fifteen dollars.

Tony:
Hey, you jack the wrong truck,

that's what happens.

I didn't notice
you rushing

to give back your fucking
DVD player.

As a matter of fact,
I'm enjoying it very much.

I screened The Bank Dick
last night.

"Did you warble,
my little wren?"

I'm not gonna pay it.

- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

No, serious is what happens
if you don't pay, by my hand.

In my thoughts,
I use the technique

of positive
visualization.

How come I always
feel undermined?

By what I did on the
Triboro Towers situation alone,

I should've been made
right then, boom.

Hm.

No, I'm fucking serious, Tony.

The books are closed.

Did you talk to Jackie
about me?

They're not accepting
any new members, okay?

You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity,

and it's not gonna be improved
by not paying the tributes

the acting boss
demands of you.

Acting boss, my ass, Ton'.
Come on.

Everybody knows
you really run things

since Jackie became
the "chemo-sabe."

( laughs )

Open the fucking door.
Open the fucking door!

Brendan:
What the fuck?

( groans )

All right. All right.

Fuck it.

But 15 grand is too much.

I'll tell you what.

You give me the 15K,

I'll talk to Uncle Junior
personally,

and maybe I can get it
to around 10.

One more thing.

You leave Comley Trucking

and every other
fucking item on this planet

that belongs to my Uncle Junior,

including his hemorrhoid
doughnut, the fuck alone.

Got it?

Yeah.

( door closes )

"Did you warble,
my little wren?"

What do you think
his commission'll be?

Two, three grand.

Ten to Junior.

We're lucky, we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

Oh, man.

Oh!

( music pounding )

Arnaz:
Who is it?

( speaks gibberish )

What?

( mumbles and coughs )

Mr. Arnaz?

What do you want?

You seen a schoolteacher's
Saturn around here?

Come here!

Anybody else here, Desi?

- Jerome: Eddie, I'm ready!
- Yep.

Here comes Lucy now.

Those people at the airport
shuttle are always late.

( whimpers )

- Eddie!
- You boys drove off

with the wrong car
a couple of days ago.

- Oh, my Christ.
- We ain't saying shit

until there's
an attorney present!

Well, go ahead.
Make a statement.

I got fucking Johnnie Cochran
right here for you!

( train whistle blares )

You boys put a real crimp
in my week.

Ah, mannagg'.

Pussy:
Get over here.

Paulie:
Hey, Puss,
here's the fucking set.

Look.

Pussy:
Fucking car's been chopped.

- Fucking useless now.
- That's not it.

Then why is
that car inside there?

You see it? That Dodge?

Why is that motherfucker
wearing a fucking plate number

I been carrying
in my shirt all week?

I don't know.

Let me tell you what's
gonna happen here.

The two of youse are
climbing over that fence

and shagging those plates.

But the razor wire--

Then one of you
stays with us

while the other goes out
on the street

and boosts another Saturn.

( sighs )

( sighs )

On the lookout for ducks, Dad?

Tony:
Know the old man
pretty good, huh?

Meadow:
Don't look so sad.

They were cute,
but remember how pissed you were

about the pool filter?

It was special,
them coming here, huh?

Don't you think?

I really wasn't into it.

( sighs )

What time's your grandma
getting here?

She had to drive Fanny
to the doctor's.

Then she is picking up
my mother and father,

and they're coming here.

They're each gonna bring
some antipast'.

Tony:
You know, I complain
about my mother all the time,

about how she just sits at home
and feels sorry for herself,

but she's always
ready to drive

those oldster friends
of hers around,

ones that can't
drive anymore.

I'm proud of her.

Gives me hope.

( car's underside dragging )

( car knocks and cranks )

Ooh, it's getting chilly
out here.

Livia:
Make plenty of noise
before you open the front door.

You never know
who's in there.

There's my Star-Ledger.

Thanks.

Oh, this street.

It's another
pain in the ass.

( tires squeal )

She broke her wrist
on the steering column.

A minor concussion.

What about the other woman?

Hip.

( winces )

We were down at the hospital
till 2:00 in the morning

talking to her doctor
and the staff gerontologist.

They're saying that she
shouldn't live alone anymore.

She can't manage
the telephone.

And yet you say she's
very healthy and alert.

Like a bull.

Why?

I'm just thinking.

And I know there are other
doctors who are right there,

but you know
from your own life

that depression
can cause accidents,

poor performance or worse.

So, what are you saying?

That unconsciously she tried
to whack her best friend?

It's interesting that you would
even take that from what I said.

Either way,
she could need a change

in her living situation,

be around more people.

Well, we were looking
at Green Grove.

That's a beautiful facility.

It's more like a hotel
at Cap d'Antibes.

Yeah.

But to her
it's a nursing home.

Well, she needs to be made
to see the distinction,

that in fact she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

I know seniors who are
inspired and inspiring.

( indistinct chattering )

You're not forgetting
about us, right, buddy?

Ladies?

Hey, we're the ones--

Kenny Portugal said,
"Say hello."

Oh, yeah, Kenny.

( car horn honks )

What the fuck is with
this cocksucker?

Bouncer:
Back up. Back up.

Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

- Whoa.
- Wow.

- Wow.
- Ho-ho-ho!

Christopher: Marty!

Kundun. I liked it.

( music blaring )

( snorts )

So my boy at Comley...

said there's a truckload
of Italian suits.

Those unload fast.

Mario'll take
the whole load.

He said the shipment moves
Thursday, 6:00 a.m.

( snorts )

Give me one good reason
I should not jack this truck.

Hey, don't feel bad.

It's Junior's own fault.

He gives us no choice
except to do it again.

Taking that outrageous
fucking tribute.

It's like not only
does he shit on our heads,

we're supposed to say,
"Thanks for the hat."

It's not like I'm getting
somewheres playing by the rules.

Fuck Tony.

"The books are closed."

- Blow me.
- No, that's some true shit.

Come on, they're not confirming
any new made guys?

- How come?
- Fucking chaos.

Nobody knows who's
running things anymore.

Guys, they don't even know

who to make payments up
the ladder to in some cases.

I'm talking about the year 2000.
The millennium.

Where do we go
from here?

Mm.

Ma, this Virginia ham...

Go, go, and get
yourself some more.

No. I'm full.

It's good, though.

You never let me feed you.

Ahem, so...

getting back to what
we were talking about...

You want that lamp?

- Ma, lie down.
- That lamp.

That's real ormolu.

You know what that's worth
when it's new?

Ma, we're fixed good,
lamp-wise, though thank you.

Take it,
and take the Barcalounger.

Somebody's gotta take this--

this stuff before I die.

Otherwise there's gonna be
an awful lot of stuff here

that the junkman's gonna
have to cart off to the dump.

Ma, you're not gonna die.

Your stuff's not gonna be
hauled off to the dump.

But you do have to start
planning for your future.

You got the most rewarding
chapter of your life coming up.

You know my good jewelry?

The stuff Dad gave you?

Yeah, some of those pieces

came right out
of Cartier's window, huh?

Listen, Carm doesn't want it.

Not now.

What we both want
is for you to live long

and wear your sparklers to your
grandchildren's graduations.

I gave it all
to your cousin Josephine.

What the fuck?
The good jewelry?

She always admired it.

They don't have much money.

You gave a fucking cousin
Cartier dinner rings,

and you give me
a vibrating chair?

Your wife never showed
any interest in my jewels.

She never complimented me
on any of it, as I can remember.

You listen to me, now.

Before you do any more
serious damage

to yourself or your
grandchildren's inheritance,

you're gonna stop
living alone right now.

I'm not going
to that nursing home.

Green Grove is
a retirement community,

and it's more like a hotel
at Cap d'Antibes.

Who's he?

A captain who owns luxury hotels
or something.

I don't know.
That's not the point.

The point is, I talked
to Mrs. DiCaprio over there,

and she's got a corner suite
available with a woods view.

It's available now
but it's gonna go fast.

Of course it's available.
Somebody died.

Oh, Ma, you gotta stop!
You gotta stop with this--

this black poison cloud
all the time,

'cause I can't take it anymore!

Oh, poor you!

You know, I got
problems at work.

I got problems at home.

I got a friend who's been
diagnosed with cancer.

Most parents would be grateful
if their yuppie children

put as much thought
into this as I did.

I'm not going to that place.

Then I will go to court,
and I will get a durable
power of attorney over you,

and I will place you there.

Then kill me now.

Go on. Go.

Go into the ham
and take the carving knife

and stab me here.

Here! Now! Please!

It would hurt me less
than what you just said.

You know, I know seniors
that are inspired!

( sobbing )

( door closes )

Yo, Monty, we said
we'd meet out front.

You're not even dressed.

I'm taking a pass.

What?

It's Italian suits,
Christopher.

There was a time in my life when
being with the Tony Soprano crew

was all I ever dreamed of.

So, what am I doing?

This is some fucking note here!

Shh. Don't wake her up.

Come on. It's 5:15.

Maybe one reason why things
are so fucked up

in the organization these days
is guys running off,

not listening
to middle management.

Fuck Tony. That's a quote.

We have to stick together.

Why be in a crew?

Why be a gangster?

Hey, coach?

Suck my dick.

Yeah.

- ( cigarette fizzes )
- ( door opens )

Yo! Hey, yo!

We need some help over here!

Okay, let's be
very cool, yo.

Get down
out of the cab!

You heard the motherfucker!

- Hurry up!
- Yo, chill.

I'm a friend of Billy's,
your friend on the inside?

Yeah? Cool.
No probs here.

"Increase the peace."
That's our motto.

I'm gonna take my lunch, okay?

Brendan:
Yeah, whatever. Come on.

Hold up, man.
You can't drive a Fisher-Price.

( starts truck )

What's with the gun
pointed sideways shit?

( truck engine
cranks and revs )

( laughs )

Get out! Come on! Get down!

You drive.
I'll direct you.

( brakes hiss )

Oh!

Jesus!

Control your shit, fool!

Fuck. Oh, fuck! Fuck!

Fuck!

Fuck! Junior-fucking-Soprano's
gonna go apeshit!

Fuck!

You excited about coming
to live with us, hon?

You will be. Trust me.

Oh, look, Ma!

Here's your stuff.

- Wow, they made good time.
- Tony: Yeah.

You got your own bed
and your dresser.

You know, when my grandmother
went to live elsewhere,

they weren't allowed
to bring personal effects.

All right, Ma,
you gotta sign right here.

( phone beeps )

DiCaprio: Yes?

Mr. Soprano,
do you have an Uncle Junior?

He tracked me down here?

Line two?

Here you go.

Tell him I'll call him back.

He'll return the call.

He did?

Apparently, it's urgent.
She said he sounded upset.

He'll call back.

Livia, did you ever hear
the old Italian saying?

My aunt used to go...

( speaking Italian )

What does that mean, Bonnie?

Time and patience change
the mulberry leaf to silk.

( birds tweeting )

You'll be all right?

Yeah. Sure.

Thanks for all your help.

I'm gonna make us
a nice lunch.

I got some fantastic
prosciutt' in there.

( phone rings )

Hello?

Yep.

It's Christopher.

Yeah?

Christ, I've been
calling for hours.

Give me a call back
on an outside line.

( rings )

T, don't get mad.

There's been a little shit.

I had nothing
to do with it,

- so you know.
- Spit it out.

Brendan hit Comley again.

He what?

And, uh...

the driver, you know--

No, I don't know.

I don't know.

He caught some friendly fire
or something, and he's gone.

Oh, fuck.

Well, what do we do, T?

Now, Brendan didn't
fence the load,

because now he's thinking
maybe it was Mario

who dimed us
to Junior last time.

Fuck!

( sighs )

Hey, Ton'.

Sorry you have to wreck
your Saturday like this.

Tony:
You boys.

You boys, I'll tell you.

It's beautiful stuff, though.

- Ton', I'm so sorry.
- Shut up.

Just so long as you
realize I had nothing
to do with this, Ton'.

Ton', that's true.
He stood home.

Shut up.

Stood home?

Did you do anything
to stop it?

Did you offer any guidance?

What do we mean
when we say "leadership"? Hm?

Ton', part of it's the crank,
you know,

but I'm going into detox,
swear on my mother.

Brendan,
shut the fuck up.

You wanna get me clipped?

What are we gonna do?

What you're gonna do is
you're gonna take these suits,

you're gonna put them
back in the truck,

go over to Comley's main yard
and give them back.

Oh, fuck!

Tony:
And then you're gonna
call my uncle,

and you're gonna tell him
when it's done.

What about the dead guy?

You keep prodding him
with a stick.

You light a candle
to St. Anthony.

But I think you're fucked.

Silvio: Ton'...

what if this didn't go back?

Would it be a problem?

You know, I don't see you
assholes putting that rack

and that rack and this rack here
back in the truck.

Just when I thought I was out,

they pull me back in.

( chuckles )

Hey, Mr. Miller,
your car is back.

My wife dropped me off this
morning, and there it was.

It was right
in my parking spot.

My uncle Pussy
helped my dad locate it.

Your uncle Pussy?

Yeah, he's in
the car business.

Well, I don't know
what to say to your dad.

I mean, thanks,
of course.

It's nice and clean too.

Whoa. Different keys.

Probably too much to hope

my papers are still inside
the trunk here.

Woman:
It's a different color.

Whoa.

Oh.

My dad's a hero.

Mm-hm.

( sniffles )

( clears throat )

Melfi:
Did you actually
lose consciousness,

like with the ducks?

No.

Just the shortness of breath

and the white spots
in my field of vision.

Improvement.

'Cause I'm sad
to put my mother away?

Sad is good.

Unconscious isn't.

She'll be in very good hands.

You've done the best for her.

She won't speak to me.

That is sad.

But whose choice is that?

Well, somehow,
that doesn't make it any better.

Can you admit to yourself that,
yes, you're sad...

but you're very angry
and full of rage?

I'm sad.

It's hard to admit

that you might have
feelings of hatred

towards your own mother,
isn't it?

You're out of your tree.

( sighs )

Listen to me carefully.

Of course you love her.

What I'm trying to say is,

own the anger
instead of displacing it.

Otherwise,
it defines your life.

- You know--
- It needs to be acknowledged.

It's a good thing time is up.

I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

"Hate your mother."
